# HNS-server
Instructions  
Run Installation script as below.  
Then add A record to point to your server and add the TLSA generated by the script to your DNS.  

New Linux server with TLD and SLD to one directory. This installs nginx as well as setup HNS domains  
Change directory into the directory containing your website files.  
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nathanwoodburn/HNS-server/main/linux`  
`sudo chmod +x linux`  
`sudo ./linux <HNSDOMAIN>` # Use your TLD. This adds a wildcard so *.[HNSDOMAIN] will point to these files  


Add a new TLD to a previously setup Linux server with TLD and SLD to one directory.  
Change directory into the directory containing your website files.  
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nathanwoodburn/HNS-server/main/addtld`  
`sudo chmod +x addtld`  
`sudo ./addtld <HNSDOMAIN>` # Use your TLD. This adds a wildcard so *.[HNSDOMAIN] will point to these files  

Add a new SLD (or dedicated TLD ONLY) to a previously setup Linux server. This uses the prexisting SSL Cert. So add the same TLSA as the previously generated one.  
Change directory into the directory containing your website files.  
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nathanwoodburn/HNS-server/main/addsld`  
`sudo chmod +x addsld`  
`sudo ./addsld <HNSTLD> <HNSSLD>` #For example nathan.woodburn would be `sudo ./addsld woodburn nathan`
